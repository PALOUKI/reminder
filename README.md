# Reminder
A reminder is a tool used to notify or prompt a person about a specific task, event, deadline, or important
information at a designated time or in the future.The Reminder project is not yet fully completed, as there is still a profile section to be finished. To access the site, before uploading your zip file downloaded under the name reminder-main into the htdocs folder, rename it to Rappel. You need to create a database called create_reminders and import the file from the sql folder into that database. The site will be available at the address localhost/Rappel/index.php.
